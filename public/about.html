<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m a Shanghainese artist currently living in Japan. I speak English, Japanese, Chinese (Shanghainese), and Spanish. I enjoy painting and sketching, street dancing (locking and hip-hop), journaling, and reading. I like listening to funk & soul music, rap and sometimes K-pop!</p>

<p>This website will show you some of my art creations, my learning or living experience in Japan, and some reflections on our society.</p>

<p>I hope you find articles or artworks here that empathize with you and inspire you! (It’s still an evolving site, so more content to come.) Have fun in my cyberspace! ;)</p>
